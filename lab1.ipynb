    "- Not only are the pages formatted differently, the *data* varies from page to page.  To aggregate the data across all years, we would like to decide on a uniform data format.  Thus, you will need to make some decisions on how to map each individual result file to this common format.\n",
    "- As is often the case, there is missing data.  Some runners don't have an age, some don't have a time, etc.  Handle missing data as follows: any record that is missing a value for *any* of the *required fields* should be discarded and put into the errors file.  The required fields are those that appear in the CSV example above.\n",
    "- Try to process as many years as you can.  Years 2001, 2006 and 2009 are especially tricky and are considered optional **challenge problems**."
