    "- Smart small: debug your program on one year, then two years, etc. before unleashing it on all years.\n",
    "- The web pages contain some unicode characters that may cause problems when you try to write it out to a file.  If string `s` is a unicode string, you can encode it in ASCII as follows: `s.encode('ascii', 'replace')`.\n",
    "- Not only are the pages formatted differently, the *data* varies from page to page.  Specifically, there does not seem to be a consistent notion of race finish time (gun time, time, net time).  To aggregate the data across all years, we would like to have one consistent notion of time.  Thus, you will need to make some decisions.\n",
    "- As is often the case, there is missing data.  Some runners don't have an age, some don't have a time, etc.  Handle missing data as follows: any record that is missing a value for *any* of the *required fields* should be discarded and put into the errors file.\n",

This means it's possible to do a *longitudinal analysis*, looking at the changes in individual runner's speed over time.\n",
